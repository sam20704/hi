**Subject:** Internship Completion and Interest in Full-Time Opportunities – [Your Name]

Good morning Ashwil Sir,

With my 6-month internship at Allianz (June–December) coming to a close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the mentorship and opportunities I’ve received. The experience has been pivotal for my technical growth, and I am writing to express my strong interest in transitioning into a full-time role to continue contributing to the team’s success.

During the internship, I strengthened my end-to-end development and deployment fundamentals through the MLOps learning track conducted by Danish, gaining practical exposure to Git-based workflows, Docker containerization, CI/CD concepts, and building APIs using FastAPI (including async and REST patterns).

I actively applied these learnings to deliver the **Full-Stack Sentiment Analysis project** in collaboration with Jighnyas and successfully supported Aswin, Hari, and Rahul with the UI implementation for the **Document Translation POC**.

Currently, I am further expanding my skillset by contributing to the **SAP Chatbot** and **Legal Validation** use cases. Working on these initiatives is allowing me to explore new technical challenges, understand complex business logic, and apply my MLOps foundation to real-world scenarios.

I would be grateful for a brief discussion on suitable full-time opportunities and next steps, including the proposed role details, compensation structure, and associated benefits.

I remain available for any upcoming tasks and am happy to continue working under your guidance.

Best regards,
